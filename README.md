# CNN-as-a-feature-extractor-in-Gaze-Recognition

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) has seen a tremendous growth in the recent years and has outperformed traditional methods in many computer vision and image recognition tasks. The architecture of CNNs consists of feature extraction through convolutional and pooling layers and classification through fully-connected and softmax layers. In this paper, we investigate the two different parts of CNN in predicting physician gaze. The pre-trained CNN model based on VGG16 through transfer learning is used as a feature extractor and a K-Nearest Neighbor and a Random Forest algorithm were used as the classifier of physician gaze. The CNN-RF and CNN-KNN models were compared with the traditional end-to-end CNN model and through a series of experiments and statistical tests of significance, we show that the power of CNN comes from the features extraction part and that the fully connected layers of the CNN have comparable and similar performance to the random forest and the knn classifiers.
